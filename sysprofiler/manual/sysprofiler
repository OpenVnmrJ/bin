  Syntax:   sysprofiler
	    sysprofiler(<'acq'><,'patches'><,'net'><,'printers'>)<,'rec'> \
			<,'security'><,'users'>)
	    sysprofiler('all')
	    sysprofiler('basic')
	    sysprofiler('version')
	    sysprofiler('help')

  Description:  Displays system hard- and software configuration, see the
	        equivalent UNIX utility "sysprofiler".


  Arguments:    'acq' adds console / acquisition configuration
		     information; includes "-n" / "-net" option below.
		'basic' displays only basic output selection (Linux ONLY); any
		     other selector argument overrides the 'basic' option.
		'net' also lists the network configuration, and
                     (on spectrometer hosts) acquisition communication setup.
		'patches' also lists installed OS (Linux or Solaris) patches;
		     OS patches superseded by newer versions are not shown.
		'printers' or 'plotters' (both Linux ONLY) shows OS and VnmrJ
		     printer/plotter definitions and queue status.
  		'rec' or 'recomm' lists recommendations derived from analysis
		     (all topics).
  		'security' shows relevant OS security information
		'users' lists properties of defined VnmrJ / VNMR users and
		     operators (Linux / VnmrJ ONLY)
		The above arguments can also be combined (any order).
	        'all' combines all of the above. NOTE: in Linux, 'all' is the
		     DEFAULT output selection (for basic / minimum output only
		     use the 'basic' argument); 'all' overrides all other
		     selector arguments.
		Undefined arguments cause "sysprofiler" to abort with help
		information.
		'version' reports the command version and date.
		'help' displays a syntax guide.

  Examples:     Calls from the VnmrJ / VNMR command line, output shown in the
		text window ("Text Output" from "Process" tab in VnmrJ)

		   sysprofiler('net')
		   sysprofiler('patches')
		   sysprofiler('rec')
		   sysprofiler('help')
		   sysprofiler('version')
		Printing output, capturing the output in a file:
		   printon sysprofiler printoff
	           printon sysprofiler('all') printoff
	           printon sysprofiler('all') printoff('file_name')

  Description:  The "sysprofiler" utility serves several purposes, e.g.:
                 - For the decision whether one can upgrade a system to the
		   current version of the operating environment and/or VnmrJ,
                   reliable system configuration information (such as
		   workstation type, RAM and disk size, etc.) is essential.
		 - "sysprofiler" may help tracking down performance issues,
		   or (especially in Linux) locating configuration issues
		   (such as missing Linux libraries and patches) that prevent
		   VnmrJ or related utilities from working properly or at all.
		 - in Linux, "sysprofiler can also be used to pre-check the
		   RedHat Enterprise Linux installation (such as a "vanilla"
		   version of RHEL 5.x) prior to installing VnmrJ, in order to
		   detect missing packages or libraries that may prevent the
		   installation or the use of VnmrJ.
		"sysprofiler" (called in a UNIX shell window) gives
		comprehensive, formatted output that is easy to read:
		 - host name and workstation type
		 - BIOS information (Linux only)
		 - processor (CPU) speed
		 - memory (RAM) size
		 - total size of defined swap areas, virtual memory status
		 - total available UFS disk space
		 - size and usage (%) of defined UFS disk partitions
		 - graphics controller(s), resolution, color depth
		 - operating system version
		 - warning if only "End User" option is installed (Solaris)
		 - number and names of the installed OS patches (only with
                   "-p" / "--patches" or "--all" argument, see below)
		 - date and time stamp of latest installed OS patch (only with
                   "-p" or "--patches" argument, see below)
		 - networking setup (optional)
		 - installed / active VnmrJ / VNMR version (with revision date
		   and spectrometer type selected upon installation)
		 - VnmrJ / VNMR installation path
		 - installed VnmrJ software options (VnmrJ only)
		 - warning if "GNU C" option is not installed
		 - installed VnmrJ / VNMR patches
		 - major user library contributions installed in "/vnmr"
		 - defined VnmrJ / VNMR users
		 - defined VnmrJ / VNMR printers / plotters & their properties
		 - list of probe calibrations in "/vnmr/probes"
		 - shim settings in "/vnmr/shims"
		 - gradient shim maps
		 - acquisition networking setup & communication checks
		   (optional, on spectrometer hosts only)
		 - (limited) security information
		 - console hardware information (optional, on VxWorks based
		   systems only, omitted without "/vnmr/acqqueue/acq.conf")
		 - recommendations for disk partitioning and upgrading, if
		   applicable
		The workstation requirements for our software have been
		discussed in various issues of Varian MR News; the relevant
                articles are collected in various FAQ documents that can be
		accessed via
		    http://www.varianinc.com/products/nmr/apps/corner.html
		namely
		 - "faq/compatibility" ("Host / Workstation and Software
		   Compatibility") for general compatibility information;
		 - "faq/linux_install" ("Linux Installation and Setup") for
		   Linux-specific (pre-)installation and setup information;
		 - "solaris_install" ("Solaris Installation and Setup") for
		   Sun/Solaris-specific installation and setup information.
		With "sysprofiler" and the information in these documents
                you should be able to assess whether you need to upgrade your
		workstation for running current software.

		"sysprofiler" will (except for the "-v" / "--version" and the
		"-h" / "--help" options, of course) write its output into a
		log file in a directory "~/sysprofiler.logs" (name and full
		path are given at the bottom of the "sysprofiler" output).
		Under Linux, this log may (depending on the arguments) include
		the full list of RPM packages that are installed with the OS.

		The README file includes instructions on how to install and
		use "sysprofiler" under Linux PRIOR TO installing VnmrJ (as
		root); in this case, arguments other than "-v" / "--version"
		and "-h" / "--help" (see below) have no effect. This install
		option will produce a log file, but the software removes
		itself from the disk after use (if you want to use it after
		loading the VnmrJ software, you need to reinstall the
		"sysprofiler" contribution (preferably as vnmr1). Apart from
		this special case, "sysprofiler" must (and can) NOT be called
		as root user.

		Once installed under Linux and in "/vnmr" (by vnmr1, NOT
		root), "sysprofiler" will start with a dialog that permits
		updating the module to the latest version WITHOUT reinstalling
		the contribution.

		Known limitations: Both Ultra 5 and Ultra 10 workstations may
		be reported as "Sun Ultra 5_10" - they share the same basic
		hardware architecture. Similarly, Sun Blade 2000 computers may
		be presented as "Sun Blade 1000" - again because these models
		share the same basic architecture.

  Arguments:    With the argument syntax below, the use of double dashes
		("--", Linux standard) is recommended, but currently optional,
		single dashes (e.g., "-all") work just as well.
		 - "-a" or "--acq" adds console / acquisition configuration
		     information; includes "-n" / "--net" option below.
		 - "-b" ir "--basic" displays only basic output selection
		     (Linux ONLY); any other selector argument overrides this
		     option.
		 - "-n" or "--net" also lists the network configuration, and
                     (on spectrometer hosts) acquisition communication setup.
		 - "-p", "--patches" lists OS (Linux, Solaris) and VnmrJ
		     patches; OS patches superseded by newer versions are not
		     shown.
		 - "--pkg", "--packages" (Linux ONLY): same as "--patches"
		 - "-q", "--printers", or "--plotters" (all under Linux ONLY)
		     adds OS and VnmrJ printer/plotter definitions and queue
		     status information
  		 - "-r", "--rec", or "--recomm" lists recommendations derived
		     from analysis (all topics); note that no recommendations
		     are given if the installed version of "sysprofiler" is
		     older than 1 year.
  		 - "-s" or "--security" shows relevant OS security information
		 - "-u" or "--users" lists defined VnmrJ / VNMR users
		The "-a", "-n", "-p", "-q", "-r", "-s", and "-u" options can
		be combined, e.g.: "-anq" (in any order).
	         - "--all" combines all of the above options / output. NOTE:
		     in Linux, "--all" is the DEFAULT output selection (for
		     basic / minimum output only use the "-b" or "--basic"
		     argument); "--all" overrides all other selector arguments.
		Note: undefined arguments cause "sysprofiler" to abort with
		help information.
		 - "-v" or "--version" reports the command version and date.
		 - "-h" or "--help" displays a syntax guide.

  Examples:     Calls from within a shell window:
		   sysprofiler
		   sysprofiler -a
		   sysprofiler --acq
		   sysprofiler -a -p
