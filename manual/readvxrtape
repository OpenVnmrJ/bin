  readvxrtape - read VXR-4000/GEMINI tape		(Shell Script)
*******************************************************************************

READVXRTAPE is a UNIX command installed as part of the VNMR system to allow
to read VXR-4000/GEMINI tapes very quickly (1 - 3 minutes), but not specifi-
cally.

Syntax:		readvxrtape

Description:	readvxrtape assumes the tape has been created with
		STAPE(WRITE,DSKn,...). readvxrtape will generate a file
		tape.288, which then can be decomposed with the "decomp"
		command. If such a file already exists, it is renamed to
		'tape.yymmdd.HH:MM.288' (where "yymmdd.HH:MM" is the date
		and the current time).

		If a directory with a different number of entries was stored
		on the tape, the decomposition of the resulting file will
		fail. In such a case try renaming the file to tape.n, where
		n is a different multiple of 36. The numeric extension of
		the UNIX file name corresponds to the maximum number of
		entries in the VXR/GEMINI directory (the "I2 part of the
		FCB"). The maximum directory size on the VXR-4000 is 432
		entries (12 x 36).

		'readvxrtape' works very quickly, but does NOT allow to
		selectively extract single subfiles, nor to read a tape
		catalog. Use 'tape -q' for that purpose.
