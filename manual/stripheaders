 stripheaders - Strip headers from binary VNMR data files (UNIX)

   Syntax:   	stripheaders VNMR_binary_datafile

   Description:	"stripheaders" is meant to help exporting VNMR data for
		third party software that expects data files without
		file and block headers.

		"stripheaders" creates the following output files from a
		binary VNMR data file:
		 - <filename>.bin: the binary VNMR file without the file
		  		   and block headers
		 - <filename>.hdr: the collected headers from the binary
				   VNMR file, WITHOUT the data segments
		 - <filename>.txt: text file describing the contents of
				   the file (header)
		The original file is NOT altered by "stripheaders"!
		All data are collected in *.bin, the headers are collected
		in *.hdr, and *.txt contains readable information that should
		allow the user to determine what the new files contain (note
		that without *.hdr and *.txt the structure of *.bin is not
		known!

		For 2D data (processed in 2D mode, NOT with 'wft', the
		output files from processing expn/datdir/phasefile are
		named f1traces.bin, f1traces.hdr, f2traces.bin, f2traces.hdr
		and phasefile.txt. Either the F1 files or the F2 files can
		be missing, depending on whether in VNMR a dcon/dconi was
		done with trace='f1' or trace='f2', or both.
		Known limitation / restriction: For 2D data (processed in
		2D mode, NOT with 'wft', the file datdir/data (complex 2D
		data) CANNOT be processed with "stripheaders".
		"phasefile" and "data" are recognized by name - you should
		NOT rename these files before calling "stripheaders" on them!

		Make sure you type
			flush
		in VNMR before processing data in the current experiment!

   Examples:	stripheaders ~/vnmrsys/exp3/acqfil/fid
                stripheaders ~/vnmrsys/exp3/datdir/data
                stripheaders ~/vnmrsys/exp3/datdir/phasefile
		stripheaders myfid.fid/fid
