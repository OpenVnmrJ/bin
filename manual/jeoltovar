jeoltovar	Convert JEOL data to VNMR format and retrieve

Syntax:		jeoltovar<(JEOLfilename<,JEOLfilename_2>)>
		  where JEOLfilename is the file name WITHOUT any extension;
		  files names JEOLfilename.GXP (or .gxp) and
		  JEOLfilename.GXD (or .gxd) should exist
		if no argument is supplied, the macro will ask for the name;
		for phase-sensitive 2D spectra (States-Haberkorn), two
		filenames must be supplied (no interactive mode).

Description:	Converts JEOL data to VNMR format and reads it into the
		current experiment. This program has been tested with data
		from a GSX-270 and an EX-400, both with PDP11 computers (?).
		JEOL data consist of two files: a data file with a '.GXD'
		extension and a parameter file with a '.GXP' extension.
		JEOL data files are simply binary data. The parameter file
		conversion may be only partially correct and may not work
		for other versions of JEOL software, but it is implemented
		as a MAGICAL macro and hence easily accessible to user
		modification. For example, on two different JEOL
		spectrometers, the observe frequency is OFR on one and
		OBFRQ on the other.

		If you use ftp to transfer data from JEOL to Sun, it is
		ESSENTIAL to copy the GXP file in the default ASCII mode
		and then change to BINARY mode to copy the GXD file.

		If transferring data to the Sun via Sun DNI (DecNET)
		(initiating the transfer at the Sun), *.GXP files must be
		copied in the normal mode, whereas *.GXD files MUST be
		copied with the -v (verbatim) option of the dnicp command.
		Sun DNI software converts all filenames to lower case.
