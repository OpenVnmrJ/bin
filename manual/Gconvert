***********************************************************


SHELLSCRIPT
-----------

The UNIX shellscript Gconvert can be run from within UNIX using the
following format:

                Gconvert <vxrfiles>
                Gconvert <directories>


Gconvert without argument looks at all files with numeric suffix in the
current directory; alternatively such files can be specified as argument(s).
If the files found (or specified) are VXR fids (e.g. COSY.5), they are
converted to VNMR format (cpos_cvt); if they are VXR-directories (e.g.
DSK2.288), then they are decomposed (decomp), and Gconvert is called on
all the files contained in the decomposed directory. Whenever the decompo-
sition, resp. the conversion, was successful, the "source" file is deleted.
Alternatively, directorynames can be given as arguments - Gconvert will
the recursively descend into those directories and convert any VXR fid
it finds therein.

Data files (e.g. SAMPLE.DAT) and VXR programs (e.g. from COMLIB) are NOT
touched; similarly, VNMR files are left untouched.

If a conversion or decomposition would result in a filename that already
exists, the current VNMR file is renamed to <filename>.bkup.<date>.
